    <h1>Let's Cook Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../image/lasagna.jpeg">
    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
    <p> <strong>Ingredients:</strong> </p>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
        <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <strong>
        Steps:
    </strong>    
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>enjoy yourself!</li>
